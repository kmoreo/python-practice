# python-practice
Some exercises completed in the name of learning python. 

I more or less followed along with [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) and completed exercises as necessary. I skipped Appendix A: Command Line Crash Course and Ex0: The Setup since I am already familiar with writing Ruby and working from the command line.
